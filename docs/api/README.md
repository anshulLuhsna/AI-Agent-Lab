# AI Agent Integration with QuestDB, VSCode, and Grafana

This repository contains the API definitions required to configure an AI Agent to interact with QuestDB, VSCode, and Grafana. Each integration allows the AI Agent to perform specific operations, such as querying databases, managing dashboards, and editing code. Below are the details of how the AI Agent interacts with each tool, along with a brief description of the AI Agent API.

## QuestDB Integration

The AI Agent can interact with QuestDB using two primary methods:

### 1. PostgreSQL Wire Protocol
- **Description**: This method allows the AI Agent to connect to QuestDB using the PostgreSQL wire protocol, enabling SQL operations such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `SELECT`.
- **API Definition**: See [postgresql_wire_protocol.md](./questdb/postgresql_wire_protocol.md) for details.

### 2. REST API
- **Description**: QuestDB also provides a REST API for interaction. This method supports SQL queries through HTTP requests.
- **API Definition**: See [rest_api.md](./questdb/rest_api.md) for details.

## Grafana Integration

The AI Agent uses the Grafana REST API to create, manage, and delete dashboards, as well as to query data visualizations.

### Grafana REST API
- **Description**: The REST API allows for complete programmatic control over Grafana dashboards, including creating panels, managing users, and configuring data sources.
- **API Definition**: See [rest_api.md](./grafana/rest_api.md) for details.

## VSCode Integration

The AI Agent interacts with VSCode through the VSCode API, enabling it to edit, run, and debug code within the IDE.

### VSCode API
- **Description**: This API provides the ability to automate tasks in VSCode, such as opening files, making edits, running code, and managing extensions.
- **API Definition**: See [vscode_api.md](./vscode/vscode_api.md) for details.

## AI Agent API Specifications

The detailed API specifications for the AI Agent have been documented in a separate file. This includes comprehensive information on endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms.

- **API Specifications File**: See [api_specs.md](./ai_agent/api_specs.md) for detailed specifications.
